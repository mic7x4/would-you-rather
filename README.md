## How it works

You are only required to choose a user from the dropdown list and start playing!

`Please note that the Login button won't work if no user is selected!`

In this game you should be able to login after choosing a user and see your unanswered and answered questions from the homepage.

From that view, you can click to view a specific poll in a specific category (answered or unanswered).
If the poll is unanswered, you'll be presented with 2 options that you'd rather choose from.
If the poll is answered, you'll be presented with the poll result, with your chosen answere highlighted in red, the total votes and percentage for each option.

## Adding Questions

When logged in, you can select "New Question" from the menu bar and you'll be presented with a form to fill your desired 2 options. After submitting the form, you'll be redirected to the homepage where your asked question will be categoried according to whether you have answered it or not

`Please note that the submit button won't work if any of the options is empty or if you entered similar options!`

## The Leaderboard

As a user asks and answers more question, their score goes up. The score is a total of the user's asked and answered question questions. When you click on "LeaderBoard", you should see a list of users in a descending order based on their score.

## Logout

You should be able to be logged out when you click on "Logout" from the menu bar.

# Enjoy the game!
